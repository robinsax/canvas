# canvas Installation

canvas requires 3 applications:
* Python 3 (with PIP)
* PostgreSQL 9.6+ 
* Node JS (with NPM)

On Ubuntu, these can be installed using the script `./etc/install_dependencies.sh`. 

Once its dependencies are installed you can install all required Python and Node packages by running.
```
python3 canvas --init
```
